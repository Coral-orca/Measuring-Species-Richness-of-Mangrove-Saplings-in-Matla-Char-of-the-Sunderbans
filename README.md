# Measuring Species Richness of Mangrove Saplings in Matla Char of the Sunderbans
## Abstract
A lanceolate-shaped mid-channel bar can be seen forming soon after the construction of the bridge over the Matla River near the town of Canning. Within a few years, the mid-channel bar grows in length and width, but the height does not change much. But when vegetation appears after that mid channel bar, the height of the tidal bar gradually increases at a rapid rate. The vegetation settling on the mid channel bar are characteristically the seedlings of the mangrove species. The ten identified mangrove species grown in the tidal bar show species richness and relative diversity when the sampled data are computed using Shannon Wiener Index including other diversity indices.
